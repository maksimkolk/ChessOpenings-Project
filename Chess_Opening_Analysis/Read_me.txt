The presentation can be found in the same folder as the Read_me.txt file.

To get the plots from the powerpoint of the big lichess dataset the file "main_file.py" and "chess_analysis" has to be run.

To get the clustering of the small lichess dataset, the file "ngrams_test.py" has to be run.
Additionally in this script the cosine simularity matrix, dendrogram and the distribution is plotted.
However no conclusions are drawn from these plots. 

(Assumtion: Both datasets are from lichess, so there is no difference in the data between the datasets)

To run the scripts in Git Bash the following command has to be used: "python Scripts/main_file.py".
